					<h4>This is an extension of my serious "web design" site. &nbsp; I made a "Silly Walks" site for an HTML class a few years ago. &nbsp; I loved it and wanted to update it a little. &nbsp; I'm using it now to show off my personality a little. &nbsp; I'm not an "all work and no play" kind of girl.</h4>
					
					<ul>
						<li>I enjoy silly things.</li>
						<li>I love Monty Python (whom is the inspiration for this project).</li>
						<li>I take silly pictures of myself.</li>
						<li>I like to share silly stuff with others.</li>
					</ul>
	
					
					<h4>Things to do here:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Submit your own silly walk.</li>
						<li>View other people's images of their silly walk submissions.</li>
						<li>Get your foreign statements translated into English.</li>
						<li>Go look at the silly pictures I take of myself.</li>
					</ul>
